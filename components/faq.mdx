### I don't know how to code, can I still participate?

Yes! Making a Linux Desktop doens't require one to know programming! Anyone who can surf the internet and can edit a bucnh of files can setup a cool looking Linux Desktop!

### I am a beginner in Linux, is this competition for me?

Yes! and we think it is the best way for you to learn how to use and configure Linux!

Also who knows, you might end up winning the competition ðŸ‘€

### If I am not from Asia and Africa, am I still eligible?

You can still participate in the competition and if we like your Desktop Setup we can give you a shoutout too. 

But, we won't be able to send you stickers, as this competition is being organized by the Asia Pacific team of Hack Club.

### When will the winner be anounced?

Most probably by first week of August!

### How long it will take to ship my stickers?

We will ship the stickers from our end as soon as possible but shipping speed varies from country to country, so it will depend on where you live!

### What does the site mean when it say it will anoint the winner as "Linux Knight"?

Apart from giving the stickers we will also give shoutout to the winner from our social media { Hack Club Asia's } handles and we will give them the title of "Linux Knight"!

Sounds fun right?

### Whom to contact if I have any other doubt?
